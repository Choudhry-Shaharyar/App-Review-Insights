MyExpenses,Corey Lathan,love it,5
MyExpenses,Arnaldo Cícero Bezerra,This is one of the best management tools that I've ever used.,5
MyExpenses,akshay porwal,Best Toll,5
MyExpenses,Kamil Hiero,"Wow, such an application, on Android device of all places. For now, beats every Personal Finance solution available for desktops. Bravo.",5
MyExpenses,Grampy,"Would like to change format of transaction screen so that ""payee/party"" is at the top and bolded. Also, when I back up to Dropbox, then restore on a different device, there is a difference in the cleared total at the top of the transaction screen.",3
MyExpenses,Monther Tariq,"Hands down the best budgeting app you'll need. Has pie charts and is continually updated. Great, timely support from the devs. Highly recommended purchasing at least the extended key. Has cloud and local backups. The problem is that cloud backups often face problems and you have to delete it and set it up again.",4
MyExpenses,Logan Spencer,"Awesome app, perfect for keeping a close eye on what you do with your money. I use it to budget and it works great.",5
MyExpenses,Shyamlal kumawat,good,5
MyExpenses,P A,"Pretty good but uninstalled. No split transactions in the free mode & no info on how to best input & track sales taxes & is an extreme weak point. Some user locations have local, state and federal taxes, so 2+ taxes to be applied to a split expense. Inputting as an expense or as a separate entry is a slow PITA option. Your Taxes function is on ""roadmap"" 6 years, since 2017!!! $5 price option buried and not clear? So Thanks? But misleading? $17+ to $24 USD or a subscription is too expensive!",2
MyExpenses,Naufal Shamsudeen,Not able to update,4

MyExpenses,Margie Anagnos,Very good,5

MyExpenses,Keiko C.,"I really love the app because it keeps updating but I hope you also considerate if we can edit the types of Account and I hope categories will replace on the menu since I keep going on settings then data if I editing it, so much actions. Sorry for my rant but I will keep supporting it. Thank you ☺",4

MyExpenses,j umamahes,"App is very useful but while it updating I lost my extended key,app showing ads. If you provide any key to reactivate it very useful to all.",2
MyExpenses,Akhilesh,"After years of experimenting, I have come back to this app and I can say with a fair bit of confidence that this is a really well designed finance tracker and looks much better now.

I'm managing my accounts, credit cards, expenses, transfer between accounts, savings for different purposes (as cash accounts to which I ""transfer"" from the real account where the money is, let me know if that's the ideal use scenario), and budgets. Also it backs up to the cloud everyday and does tons more which I haven't mentioned.",5

MyExpenses,Nidhinkozhiparambil Ram,Thank you for this awesome application,5
MyExpenses,Abdurrahman Vaiz,"Many of the basic features are paid!! The design is somehow complicated and not so good. It would be better if it was more simple. You can not choose between weekly, monthly or yearly records!",2

Easy to use, but best of all AMAZING customer service with quick responses and fixes the 2 times I ever had a problem (1 was user error on my part). Definitely 5 stars, at least!",5
MyExpenses,Emrah UYGUR,There should be no installments and credit card installments in the program. There are many programs that need to divide into installments and write the remaining amount with the remaining installments.,3

MyExpenses,Hicham Harb,The latest update wiped out my info...🙄,5

MyExpenses,christopher malambo,Great app,5
MyExpenses,vlad tut,"++: There is a loan in a simplified form (thanks), there is a recipient category and tags, there is a section with debts. --: there is no design, there is no analytics (neither by tags nor by stores), debts cannot be paid (in parts or in full, only closed).

MyExpenses,SATISH KUMAR,it looks good for now has simple and useful features. Good UI too,4
MyExpenses,KL (Kelvin),"Ngl this app is by far the best expenses tracker app. I have tried so many expenses trackers but this one is just perfect in every aspect. Easy to use. It gets you to the point unlike many expense apps out there that focus a lot on beautiful UI. I just love this app. 
Thanks Developer",5
MyExpenses,Baraa Sultan,Better app ever for payment arrangement with all small details. You don't need even for a calculator. It helps you dividing your business payments. Thanks for the Developer. You help me a lot.,5

MyExpenses,Amit,A really awesome app with one of the best UI. Just purchased the Professional key with localised currency rates😇,5
MyExpenses,Shihabudheen K,"New UI Design is hideous and consumes so much space in screen. Earlier it was very easy to duplicate transaction, now needs to go through more steps to do so",1
MyExpenses,christoph lopez,When you create a future expense the app spams you (on the planned day) with you un-deletable notifications. You are forced to open the app and then it creates a dublicate of the already existing expense! Horrible design choice for the paid version,1
MyExpenses,Johnny Kron,Sort by last used does not function properly.,1
MyExpenses,A Google user,"Update 23.11. after 2star reduction from 23.11. : after todays release this is going back to 4, even 5 stars. It is the best expense tracking app. The GUI changes, which are now completely optional, made it unusable for me temporary. Lucky I am.",5
MyExpenses,Ilia Slobodchikov,Tried a whole bunch of expense and budget trackers. Landed on this one as it allows all custom categories and convenient budget tracking. My only wish is to be able to access budgeting from the 'home' view rather than having to click on 3 dots and on 'budgeting'.,5

MyExpenses,Mike CA,"Best in play store. This is designed by someone who obviously understands accounting. No fluff and splashy graphics, gets the job done and does it very well. Developer routinely updates app with fixes and enhancements. Personal support is quick and efficient. Developer listens to user input.

MyExpenses,Cona Han,nice and easy to use with minimal ads,5
MyExpenses,Edith,"Have been looking for an android app that split expenses into different categories, record transactions in the corresponding account, keep track of who you loan money to and who you owe. Love the capabilities of the app and the low subscription fee. The only drawback is that you need to learn the system a bit as it is different from other budget & expense tracking apps, otherwise it would be a 5 star rating.",4
MyExpenses,Ashutosh Upadhyay,"Good features - you can add category and sub category under that, plus note, easy to use. Not available - chart or graphical summary, report to filter or analysis",3

MyExpenses,Nick Seaton,"Here's my long-overdue review after 2 years obsessed with this app. Served me so well for household budgets, loved it so much I now use it for my small business bookkeeping. Had to be built from the ground up with excellent functionality that meets all the needs I had for setting up all my different account types and all the various transactions that go through them and between them.

MyExpenses,Pete Longden,"Great app, used for many years... really helped me with day to finances.... thanks. Recommend",5
MyExpenses,Soorej P,The best expense tracker app i have come across. The features are very subtle in nature and takes atleast few months of usage to understand the thought process and detailing which went into the design. This can be trusted 100% since it is open source and the data is not going anywhere. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to track expenses for a long term and is concerned on privacy factors.,5

My only only issue is that after upgrading to the premium edition, you will need to do another upgrade/ subscription to use their budgeting function.

MyExpenses,A Google user,"The app looks nice and fairly simple.  Promises to be a pocket companion. Allows qif export. I even got the premium key. However, it is not allowing transfer between accounts in different currencies, which is a deal breaker for me as it makes the app next to useless on trips abroad, which is one of the main reasons to carry an app like this around.

The only thing that I have a question about is the two black icons ""transaction and transfer'. If I hit either, they tell me ""application not installed "".  I thought they would be useful shortcuts, although the transfer won't work any way because for now, I'm just using one account. Please lead me in the right direction,  as I'm sure it's user error.  But I have not un-installed anything on my Galaxy TabPro 12.2.  Rating goes to five stars if this can work (at least the transaction one). Thanks for the great app!  UPDATE 10/10 Two updates ago the new transaction icon was working and it made the app much better.

MyExpenses,A Google user,"This app seems to do everything I need being able to import my Quicken without any trouble at all. I have not tested the export yet but probably it will work just fine . One minor glitch, and that is in the category list. The list is in case sensitive alphabetical order.  This means that every category that begins with a capital letter will come before any category that begins with a small case letter. Thus ""Garbage"" will be in the list where you would expect but ""goodies"" follows ""Zebra.""",5

The hamburger menu on the login page to 'Select Client Card' does not work. It is sticky with the last account you logged in with, regardless of what account you select.

I've already logged in with my fingerprint AND this is my trusted device, why do I need to 2-factor AGAIN when I'm sending an e-transfer? Not only that, it doesn't really work, it forces me to dig out my old device - hope that it's charged - just to verify that it's me. Every. Time. I get it that this may be RBC's answer to sim swapping, but at least let me add a trusted payee so that I don't have to do this every time.",3

RBC Mobile,Brittany Friesen,"Was great until they started with the new two-step verification, especially on addresses I've sent to countless times before!

I can't turn it off and I can't set a daily limit of 0. There are no safety features. The first thing a hacker would do is to transfer all the money to another country.

When u call the toll free number virtual assistant doesn't understand what your going through and repeats the same damn thing over and over. For the worst banking experience please go for RBC bank.

RBC Mobile,Annas Mansoor,Never use this app for international money transfer.RBC claimed 0 transfer fee but while sending money to my home country dollar account. App confirmed that for CAD 1000 USD 730 would be delivered but only usd 689 were received in my home country account. Home country bank charges no money while receiving international remittances.

RBC Mobile,Misa M,The suggestions pop ups inside the app or whatever they're called are super annoying and in the way. Why did you guys add those? They weren't there before.,1
RBC Mobile,Dan Bonhomme,I didn't think I would use a phone app for banking but I am finding it very useful and convenient. I especially like the protection provided by dual verification given all the hacking and scams these dsys.,5

RBC Mobile,Kaleb Smalridge,"RBC has honestly been a hard bank with me but we are on good terms now very secure bank and very nice people who work there. It's a safe bank, let's get real every bank sucks but this has been my choice for a very long time and haven't had many problems with this company at all.",5
RBC Mobile,Fabian Michellee,Awesome,5
RBC Mobile,sixpipz,am regularly locked out of my account by failure to connect no matter my wifi. sending etransfers is now a 20 minute - 2 hour endeavor. was completely barred on the website by the supposed 2fa that would ignore my verification through the app no matter how many times. my family has been with rbc for decades but if i am going to be randomly unable to even access or look at my account how can i remain with it?,1

RBC Mobile,Ronald Morell (Captain),Deposit cheque feature is sketchy at best...,1
RBC Mobile,Metal Force,Rbc customer service and competence has really dropped over the years. I'm a customer since the 90s and I can't stand calling in anymore. Ever since you outsourced to India I can't get anything done over the phone. Why are you too cheap to pay somebody qualified a living wage in Canada? Truly shameful. I absolutely hate what your customer service has become and it's probably a preview of what your company is devolving into.,1
RBC Mobile,lurker117,It does what I want,5

RBC Mobile,Nrupal Akolkar,"No change yet. App signs out user when switching to RBC DS. As a RBC DS client one is unable to switch between RBC personal banking to DS. Even though the App has this feature, it breaks and signs out user every time. Lot of instability in switching smoothly between Personal Banking and investment account with DS. Cannot trust to have this app for use when transferring funds between account and DS if this is what happens on the go all time. Have faced this issue for over 6 months now.",1

RBC Mobile,James Goliath,It is a reasonably good app in my experience but not as good as other major bank apps I use such as TD. My main issue with the app is it is not compatible with any android tablets as far I can tell. It is long past time that this app be supported on that platform. All other major bank apps work on tablets.,3

RBC Mobile,Thomas T.,I called again..spent another 2hrs..from rbc rep to the next... finally after fault finding to notice the RBC android app is rejecting adding rbc clients to the payee list...saying the branch an or account number is not right. The app or rbc servers are incorrectly programmed. Im going to the bank tomorrow at 4pm. The 800# number rbc support did not have the skills to see this problem like I can.,1
RBC Mobile,Arron Arron,The app has problems. Why force two factor authentication with notification if you can't make the app work.,1
RBC Mobile,Nathan Allender,"Keeps turning on 2 factor verification without my consent. Turn it off and log back in and it's on again. Please fix, other than that It's good. (Update: Uninstalled and skipped choosing trusted device seems to work that way)",4

RBC Mobile,Angus Losier,"The new forced 2 factor authentication feature is a useless broken mess. It simply fails entirely at the most basic function of providing a notification for authentication. I resent being forced to use it. It blocks basic payments and has made me less secure by putting me at risk of defaulting on bills and rent. Shameful, incompetent garbage. It should be rolled back immediately until it can be implemented properly.",1
RBC Mobile,Mal Mcloud,Thumbs up very optimal...I like the skin. Navy blue seals...not to be confused with marine 5. I told her baby no way. Welcome 2 Canada. This was me when I had 5 shots left.

RBC Mobile,S S,"UPDATE: It doesn't even let me sign in now. How wonderful. PAST review: Even after setting up notifications for the tansactions, I mostly never get any notification, except some random times. Didn't even get my credit card statement this time. When you get late because of that, then the bank will leave no chance to penalize. Why have such technology when it doesn't do what it is supposed to?",1
RBC Mobile,Simon Lee,"I was fine using online banking but they now force you to install this app. Then they force you to use NFC verification with client card and/or drivers license verification which I've tried on 2 different phones and both methods don't work. The drivers license is circular. After taking pictures etc it kicks you out to religion... then requires you to validate drivers license.. then takes you out to tech issue unable to process...I'm stuck unable to do any banking can't do ""simple"" e transfer.",1
RBC Mobile,Daniel Tong,"20231130: update how can the app be so unreliable and unstable? I am doing the etransfer and keeps fresher out after submission. you made me feel I didn't pay the monthly fee. Garbage Especially the investment part is the most stupid thing ever. Slow, cannot see live ask and bid, won't stop nor alert you if you buy a stock that is not accepted by TFSA account. Not even an email to tell you it got rejected until your next login to check. Suggestion: Go check how other banks or platform do it bef",1

RBC Mobile,LadyJ,Seems so far it's working well for me so far. My only complaint is in the Budget settings it doesn't recognize Rogers Telecom as a utility company type it doesn't really belong in the other items you can pick.

First of all it keeps saying the password is incorrect, then it has the authentication error message. I have had to uninstall/reinstall this app every time I need to use it.

It boggles my mind that after having 3 different banks that I use for different reasons and Scotia is the only one that can't keep the glitches out of their on line banking.

Scotiabank clearly doesn't care about their customers and has 0 intention of fixing this awful app. Is there any quality control at all before you release a new app into production? It's been broken for weeks and no one cares! When my mortgage is up for renewal I'm moving to another bank as this is ridiculous.",1

Sometimes we just need to have money inward and outward on the same category. Hope you can include this function. It will be useful.,4
TrackWallet,Shehzad Ansari,Superb app just needed multiple profile option.,5
TrackWallet,GAURAV BINDAL,Suggestion: The Budget does not account for the refund received it just show the expenses. Otherwise it is simple and smooth experience,4
TrackWallet,Joanne Edgecombe,"This is a really good app. Keeping track of expenses etc is fantastic. The only thing missing is being able to set or forecast expected costs for the various categories and subcategories, then tracking spend against those amounts. So if I estimate that I'll spend £100 on groceries, I can see how much I spend against how much I budgeted to spend. Feature request!",4
TrackWallet,Nikita Odnorob,"Found an annoying bug preventing me from using this app. Set the main currency USD and add two incomes: +$10 and +€10 (= $10.78). Then change the main currency to EUR. Whether you keep or update currency rates, the first transaction will be converted to +€10 (=$10). In other words, currency rates will be ignored and 1:1 rate will be used instead. And it will be shown ""€20"" total income in the cash flow, and it's definitely wrong",3
TrackWallet,Carlos Feleciano,Best budgeting app I've used so far,5
TrackWallet,Ankit Singh,Great App and loved the interface.🤩,5

TrackWallet,Sarath kumar,Thank you Team for quick response.,4
TrackWallet,Garry Christian,"it is really good. has the best design out of other similar app and with complete feature too. but i would suggest to make hour UX to only one method, either from visual clock or with keyboard. because sometimes the keyboard show up and sometimes not",5
TrackWallet,allocated____ __,"A very good app for personal finance tracking. Just to add some more functionality. Please add daily savings goal tracker in this So I can track how much saving left to reach my goal. Also add report for it too like avg daily saving  Avg weekly saving, avg monthly savings, amount to reach to goal (daily, weekly,  monthly) like that. If you add that just ping me by replying this. Thank you",4
TrackWallet,Eric,"Looks very well designed. However, doing negative entry for an Expense category (as refund) is a feature I cannot live without.",4

TrackWallet,Raymond vaz,Bad,1
TrackWallet,Chellapandi CP,Excellent app but need to have option for lend and borrow amount,4
TrackWallet,Eunice Barcenas,"Great layout and aesthetic I have to give the developer that. I really like the app so please take this suggestions: The only way to access the minimum feature is through premium? I was going to create more accounts since I have more, but a max of 3? That makes this bad. (Some other apps have this feature and we don't even have to pay. Understand that you have alot of competitors with this category, this simple feature can make the downloads go down). Account categories, such as card, loans etc.",2
TrackWallet,Mang Juan,"Simple, clean, direct design. Easy to navigate making tracking seamless.",5
TrackWallet,Abhishek raj Gupta,A brilliant and simple application which does it's job perfectly.,5
TrackWallet,Thomas Sánchez,"This app is undeniably aesthetically pleasing, boasting detailed graphics and a user-friendly interface. However, its steep price tag may deter some users, though those willing to pay might find value in its offerings. One area for enhancement would be the inclusion of a feature allowing users to edit categories and subcategories, adding more customization options.",3
TrackWallet,Abul Iqbal,"yes, it is a good app. I recommend it for others. helps to track my spending.",4
TrackWallet,Bhaskar BM,"Paid version, no sync option",1
TrackWallet,Johanna D. Alvarado,"Easy to use, useful, beautiful UI. Love it so far.",5
TrackWallet,Sythysto,"Looks good, quick to add transactions, nice features. The budget feature is cool, mostly because it tells you how much you can spend per day. What is missing and is extremely important is selecting multiple transactions at the same time in order to delete them. Also it'd be nice if you could also have a note tab.",3
TrackWallet,Bahae Hamrit,"The calendar in last update, its super usefull 👏👏👏 Best tracking app in playstore i recommand every one to use it",5

TrackWallet,Aditya Jain,Love the app.,5
TrackWallet,Patricio Castagnaro,Transactions must be added by manually. No option to connect bank accounts and/or digital wallets,3
TrackWallet,Oliver Balint,Luv it. Request: option to see scheduled transactions on calendar rather than the single option to see it In list format only.,4
TrackWallet,Kyle f,I think this is the best finance app if all you want to do is track and categorize expenses. Entering them is super easy and you can add the widget to your home screen so you don't even have to launch the app.,5
TrackWallet,Merlin Dayana,"I love using the TrackWallet app! It's an excellent financial planner that helps me effortlessly track my budget. The intuitive interface makes it easy to manage my finances, and the detailed insights provide valuable information for smarter financial decisions. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay on top of their money game!",5
TrackWallet,Rahul Kolte (RaKo),Great app. Tried quite a few before finding this one. One thing that I would like to see us a graph of historical spendings in a particular category.. month on month to result view how I'm spending and if I'm able to cut down based on previous month for that category. But all in all . A great app!!!,5
TrackWallet,Fikri Ramdhani,"I've tried almost all apps on playstore for my personal expenses and TrackWallet is awesome app. But i need sync to my google account, and i need loan/debt manager. I hope in the next update i can use that features.",4
TrackWallet,Pablo Gómez Castrillo,"One of the best expense tracking apps I've tried so far, and I tried a lot of them, and none of them had the feature I was looking for the most, the possibility of creating subcategories inside the main category, THIS ONE HAS THAT, which I'm super grateful for. Also their widget is SUPER useful. Nice design, very intuitive, plus very useful insights and reports. Just found a little bug, contacted the team and they quickly responded, so very nice customer service as well 😊",5
TrackWallet,George Hany,"The app is great. I would like to make few suggestion tho. There should instructions added to explain app features, the app is simple but I didn't how to remove templates until I contacted support. I have subscribed monthly but If I want to change to yearly it seems I have to unsubscribe first, an option to update payments preference should be added in the app. Also If you could add a section for investements that would be great",5
TrackWallet,varun jasani,"I hope you read this. while adding a transaction we have majorly 3 categories viz. Expense, Income, transfer. It would be nice if you add one more category called Investments, don't link this category to any other investing app. Just think about it as it would be a major update.",5
TrackWallet,Rahul Choudhary,"Really a very good app for managing all the expenses. There are no ads, but lots of features. Really glad found this app. 10 stars",5
TrackWallet,David Fanelli,Great app,5
TrackWallet,Game Mode,"The app is exactly what I'm looking for; simple, functional, and lightweight. Except, it doesn't have a local backup feature. Although cloud backup is available it isn't suitable for everyone. I'm sure the developer(s) will take this complaint into account and implement a suitable solution. Thank you.",4

TrackWallet,Harshit Sapaliga,just wow,5
TrackWallet,Md Humayun Kabir Akash,Goof,5
TrackWallet,Renuka Barahate,After trying several apps for finance management I found this app quite good. It runs smoothly and is least complicated. I can track my expenses as this shows reports accurately. The only problem giving it 4 stars is they should add feature of importing previous transaction file data and also having automated sms tracker to keep track of online transactions. I prefer it not doing manually. Other features no problem. Its accurate app and provides sufficient features as per who are free users.,4
TrackWallet,Lucky Jain,"Last update with calendar view, just perfect 👍. Subscription is actually worth it ☺️. So i just came across this idea i talked about investments recently. Would it be possible to have accounts with simple/compound interests, with date selection for effective interest calculation + option to choose between savings account (expendable) vs fixed deposits (non-expendable)? Might be asking too much since it's technically already possible in app, except have to do it manually, to show them in ledger",5

TrackWallet,S Jairaj Rao,Superb,5
TrackWallet,Daniel Brown,"Amazing app, does everything that I need, but one suggestion. On the total balance screen, in the amount on the left hand side, is there any way we could have the option to put the currency at the beginning, so instead of 10£, give the option to have £10. It works in all other sections, apart from the chart on total balance. Apart from that, flawless",5

Also where is the upload CSV? And in transactions, the name (notes) of each item e.g onions, should be more important (as the heading) with it's category, food, being the smaller text.

TrackWallet,Madhav Sane,खूप उपयोगी 👍,5
TrackWallet,Mugisha Dieubon,It's easy to use and I love the interface of the app. however I would like it if I can be able to set a goal of amount I want to save in account with track of it. and setting budget it doesn't show how much you spent and how much remains and I use premium.

TrackWallet,Naveen Savinda Weerasekara,"Great app. I came here after my previous budget tracking app (budget bakers) started to show the ads. I love the way of adding transactions in this app where we can do it in one handed mode. Expecting this app would develop further and then I will go for the full time premium. One small suggestion, it's great if we can see all the past entries in the notes section & If it filters while type, so we are one click away from the repetitive transactions.",5
TrackWallet,Timothy Phiri,Just what i have been looking for,5
TrackWallet,Bob Dawkins,Charging as a subscription is a terrible idea and awful way to save money ;) Make a lifetime 1 off payment by all means but you lose so many customers charging monthly for an app that already exists 10 times for free on play store.,1

TrackWallet,Deborah Gilharry,Love it! Very easy to use! Great App!,5
TrackWallet,Harsh Singh,"Hello Development team🙂, I started using this application from around last 3 days amd overall very happy with it.

Kindly consider this🙏😇 And Thanks for this app✨️💗☺️",5
TrackWallet,Ian Jonas,"I paid a 1 month subscription to navigate the entire UI before diving in fully. This app has a great design. Love the colors. Love the icons. Very sleek. But there's one huge problem in the Accounts section. There's no dedicated Debts subsection. They're all stacked in the same tab. It's hard to identify positive and negative balance in one glance. Red/green distinction plus separation should help. For this particular feature, I highly recommend the app 1Money.",2

TrackWallet,jay Sher,good app 😀,5
TrackWallet,Prashanth P Bharadwaj,No India rupees option in this app,1
TrackWallet,Catherine Vega,2 things i hope you can add/fix 1) add carry over function 2) budget (there's one but it too complex i just dont use it),3
TrackWallet,Inamul Hassan,It's was really good and this was the app I was searching for very long time. I'm ready to pay for paid features. I would like to know how the pdf report of this app works. Can you send me the a sample version of pdf report to my mail ID so that I could go for a paid version,4
TrackWallet,Chris H.,"Track Wallet is uncluttered, intuitive, simple and solid. This app really fulfills my need to know my checking account balance as I'm paying down my debts. I write a running paper total on my magnet white board. But I'd sometimes forget to update it from receipts when I got home. Then I'd wonder why there's a discrepancy with my checking account. But now I just update it from TW. The categories of expenses in TW are not some extra fluff but are real life/practicaI. I've been using TW a few days.",5
TrackWallet,Sambit kumar Samanta,Where is the bill reminder?? Apart from that its all good,3
TrackWallet,AZIZUL MANIK,Undoubtedly it's a wonderful apps but It will be more popular if apps authority will allow to track personal savings transections .,5
TrackWallet,Benas Molis,"I love the app and I am glad to have paid for the premium version. The only issue I have is the inability to change the order of recurring transactions by dragging despite being able to reorder everything else in the app. I have sent this criticism to the developer directly. Once this is fixed, I'll update my review and bump the rating to 5 stars.",4
TrackWallet,Mridul Gain,A very useful app for tracking expenses and creating budgets.,5
TrackWallet,Joseph Moulton,I have seen this app improve tremendously. I am glad to see that the developers are actively working to make it a really nice financial app. Needs to allow initial negative balance for credit cards. Otherwise 5 stars.,4
TrackWallet,Yuvarajan Rajendiran,"Best expense tracking app and I would recommend to everyone since the free version doesn't contain any Ads and most importantly it is user friendly, much clear with categories and sub-categories. Even you can customize them as per your need. Would like to explore more features in the upcoming updates",5
TrackWallet,TD Thang,"Smooth, functional and so helpful to track daily purchases and saving. After a few months, I have decided to go with the premium package and will use it as my main tracking one. Hope the dev will continue to maintain/update the app with more amazing features.",5
TrackWallet,Sam Ndirangu,"Very good. And a great , functional and smooth UI. I wish the app could have shadows for the cards so it's easier to see. But so far the best budget app I have used.",5

TrackWallet,Brian Newhouse,"After having an issue with the app, the developer helped make it right. This is an awesome app, easy and simple to use. Highly recommend.

TrackWallet,Namith Jain J,"Excellent experience, great UI! One thing to be added is import data option. Where somebody using similar app needs to shift to this there is no import option. I was using Go dutch earlier which got shut down but I have fill all data manually. Please bring this to IOS",5
TrackWallet,Tirumala Rao,Excellent App.. Very Usefull and very easy ui..,4

TrackWallet,victor Atujuna,I love it very much,5
TrackWallet,Nayeem Ashwaq,Very nice app,5
TrackWallet,Andy Kow,"So far I am impressed with how the application looks, feels and functions. Simple with just enough icons, colors and splendid charts to give a visual aide to help visualize the numbers. Customization of Categories is by fast the best out of the other competition. A web version would be helpful in the future.",5
TrackWallet,Kevin Maxell Rabanal,Love the app! Hopefully in the future you can add forecasted balance left at the Month after adding in the recurring income and recurring expense each period,5
TrackWallet,Paresh Padsala,"Great App 👍👍👍👍 But There is a suggestion that there is an icon in the category, please add more of it.",5
TrackWallet,A A,"Pros: App dev is responsive to reviews (thank you dev for your responses and hard work!). Hopefully future updates will keep bringing back functionality. Great basic functionality to add accounts, enter negative for debt. Can customize account color and icon. Analytics are helpful. Con: Lost the ability to add an interest percentage on accounts with a recent update. Cannot count transfers towards a category or budget.",4
TrackWallet,Mukhtar Ali,A great app. Only missing thing was that there was no field to add description while adding expenses. If that was the case a 5 star was guaranteed. If possible add that feature.,5
TrackWallet,Sanaullah Khan,Very good app,5
TrackWallet,kishor kumar,Simple and Clean yet detailed UI easy to log and view data. Excellent work dev. ⚡👍,4
TrackWallet,RUMELI CHANDRA,For the first time I've came to write a review for an app...such a good app ..so easy to use ..clean UI/ Ux ...loved it... Looking forward to buy the premium...,5
TrackWallet,Fayaz,This app is almost perfect. Just gonna ask for two things: 1. ability to hide the budget card 2. ability to hide the time selecting option completely while adding income/expense,4
TrackWallet,Unique Art (Paresh),"I have used more than 100 apps, I have liked this app, which is simple, easy, beautiful and great app.",5
TrackWallet,Harrison Footer,"Pretty good, but feel like having your budget as a widget for your phone desktop would be pretty useful for many people.",3
TrackWallet,Anshul Gupta,Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you for creating this app.,5

TrackWallet,Asfak Kays,Loved the app. Clean UI fast and responsive. But giving you 3star cause it's lack a feature. Add option to important csv,3

TrackWallet,Sanaullah Khan,Very well designed app.,5
TrackWallet,Venessa Mckenzie,How do I delete the current stuff I have logged.?? I want to start over,3
TrackWallet,Luke,"Great expense tracker! Super clean and minimal, with all of the information you need right up front and not hidden behind submenus or long scrolls. One feature that I wish TrackWallet had is the ability to search for Categories when entering a transaction. I often forget which ""parent"" the ""child"" category I want is in, which makes it pretty time consuming to enter in a once-in-a-blue-moon expense.",5
TrackWallet,Mani Kandan,"beautiful app.. whatever the feature I planned to design the app. everything is available.. only thing can add is share the expense between multiple user.. If it is added, app will be even more useful. but alwayz worth using the app",5
TrackWallet,Zheny Carson,Doesn't have bill reminder and debt tracker,3
TrackWallet,Swarnabha Dawn,Why we have to entry each record manually? Why the app can't read from SMS? Where every other app get the details from SMS only.,1
TrackWallet,Rahul Sharma,is there q telegram channel or page were we can check the upcoming features?,5
TrackWallet,Dmytro Maloroshvylo,One of the best apps I've used.,5
TrackWallet,Tagir Khadzhiev,"Need system theme support, not just select dark/light.",4
TrackWallet,Manmeet Saini,Very nice UI. But 1 thing missing which I think should have been included. App should show Sum of all budgets in that month. I get a fixed salary income. I was budgeting my expenses but everytime I added a budget I would have to calculate wheather my budget is going over my expense.,3
TrackWallet,Xavier Ananda,please make it available in ios,5
TrackWallet,Umair Abbas,"Great app but no backup, If we lose our mobile or install it all data will be lost, try to solve this , else remaining everything is perfect our financial circle is now in our hands we can adjust our expenses and saving with the help of this app.",3
TrackWallet,Harris,"Great app for basic level personal and business cash management. Easy and user friendly interface. Works super fast on even budget smartphones. Has colour coded tags & sub-tags for transactions. Super easy transaction filters to search exactly what you want. Supports dark theme. Transaction date/time are editable. Cloud backup available for paid version, but it's fully worth the price. SUGGESTIONS FOR OWNER: Better if we could add multiple tags, contacts & opposite entry for each transaction.",5
TrackWallet,Gerald Ward,Limited to 3 bank accounts for free and no option for credit card accounts. Looking for another app.,2
TrackWallet,Dmytro Maloroshvylo,Perfectly appealing ap with clean design and great functions.,5

TrackWallet,Kakashi,Doesn't track expenses from bank automatically though,5
TrackWallet,DIGITAL ART,"Very helpful app, a lot of amazing features, i really like it",5
TrackWallet,abdo jama,good app has all that I need except I wish developers would make dashboard cash flow chart period have a similar option to budget which is one time specifying the start and finish period of the budget.. also I wish the budget would update quicker sometimes I log in an expense that I have made without any update in my budget so I have to delete the budget and make a similar one things to update otherwise perfect app for me thanks,4

TrackWallet,Michał Ćwiek,"I like it this far. The interface is nice, not cartoon like in many apps of this type. I'm not overwhelmed with the complexity of available options. Statistics available in the dashboards are insightful.",5
TrackWallet,Zed Biteng,Would totally jump ship fully if it had import function somehow!,4
TrackWallet,Joss Arkley-Smith,"Great app, does what it says. Tracking has to be done manually, but this is a good way to keep yourself accountable",5
TrackWallet,bhau pawar,Looking for comparison report and description of item,4
TrackWallet,AKASH Devil Singh Srari,"Giving 5 star , ur best my friends",5
TrackWallet,Christian Elisha,"I have tried several expense tracking apps. I bumped into this one, because I was on a testing spree. And I am just grateful that I didn't ignore this. I disliked many of the apps I tried due to either a limited capability or lack of a modern User Interface. And this has it all.",5
TrackWallet,Abhishek C,"Nice app, feature rich, a loan management section would have been great. Is there any option for realtime synchronisation between devices ? Now it syncs only once in a day.",4
TrackWallet,Prakash Gnanam,Simple and powerful,5
TrackWallet,Muna Minaj,Perfect,5
TrackWallet,Suyog Pawar,"best app ever for recording transactions.. just a suggestion.. as I have created two bank A/Cs A acc and B acc (B is another person acc it has its separate inc. & expns).. when I want to transfer my share of amt from B Acc to A acc (which income for me).. l have to record two transaction 1st i have to show expense of B and then inc. for A acc.. ""Can u update an option for that transfer will directly show as income""",4
TrackWallet,Chandan Tanwar,It's great app for your daily budget and monthly expenses maintained,5
TrackWallet,pRiThWiSh,"The app is a useful weapon for proper budget management, applicable in Personal domain mainly. Pros : 1) Well segmented categories 2) Intuitive graph for visual analytics 3) Budgetry allocations based on month segment Points of improvement: 1) Kindly add a segment for loan and credit card. This segment's nature will be negative in monthly cycle. 2) A separate segment for Savings tracker will be good addition.",4
TrackWallet,Invicta Watches,awesome app,5
TrackWallet,Cy Gonz,Thank you so much!! I love it but I suggest have a back up or connect every email etc 🤝 Add more updates 💱,5
TrackWallet,Ramy Samy,"Amazing app, I would suggest rearranging the subcategories picker when setting a budget, awesome app overall and I would suggest lowering the price a bit as it is so steep for me to take. Thank you.",5

TrackWallet,Everton P,"Best offline expense app I've EVER used. So good I bought the lifetime license. The reporting is good and any critique I have is personal preference and not an error with the app. The sub categories is Genius. The app creator stated he's a 1 person creator but I hope the creator never drops this, it's that good!",5
TrackWallet,AS Developers,"I am using the app almost 1 month only. Loving it. Best !! UI/UX pattern is modern standard. If you're one man developer or Small team , Highly Appreciated 👍.",5
TrackWallet,Nilesh Tambe,Recently purchased premium version of this app...only thing that i can't see is the total amount for monthly budget.i can set for individual catogary....if we can see total monthly budget will be great addition.thank in advance,4
TrackWallet,Gyan Singh,It is good in everything but in free version no cloud support,3
TrackWallet,Lily Peschanskaia,"I've looked at many expense-tracking apps and this one is my favorite! I didn't want it to be fully automated like Mint, so this one is perfect. It's simple yet very functional. Beautiful and very user-friendly interface, and it has all the functions one may need.",5
TrackWallet,agbo obinna,"Purchased the premium immediately i lost my older phone and lost up to 3 months data, i knew i had to have the backup option. This app is highly recommended.... 2023 update. Then i updated it and now it has stopped",5
TrackWallet,Иван Павлов,"Finally I have found an app, that does not like a something from a past century, because everything all was bot usable and I was wasting more time trying to figure out how it is working, than planning my budget. And TrackWallet is an excellent service with atttactive style and understanble functionality.",5
TrackWallet,Lost Boy,Perfect solution to my needs,5
TrackWallet,Richard George,"Well thought app with clean, snappy, & modern UI. The only main feature I wasn't able to find in the app is to add credit cards as the source of expense. The credit card feature could be a big addition to attract more users.",5
TrackWallet,Dinesh Kohakade,"Great App, Friendly UI... Need an option to add note in *OTHER* tab Need option to record of lending (giving) money to someone",5
TrackWallet,Kaushik Patel,It will be good if we can book travel expenses under a separate tag and manage loans payable and receivable both in this app.,4
TrackWallet,Kirit Panchal,Excellent...,5
TrackWallet,Mamadou Diagne,Great app to keep track of your money. I am using it since 10 days and I cant make a transaction without recording it in the app. Plus you can set a notification to remind you to log transactions. 👌🏾,5

TrackWallet,Chakrit Udomsilp,Best app for me in the market for expense tracker,5
TrackWallet,Laro Selcouth,"I've searched long and far for a good spending tracking app. Let me tell you, this hits all the points that all other apps lack. I can't write all of this in a review, but it has everything I could ask for, and it's for free. There is a $9.99 option to pay for full access--that's if you want to put in unlimited accounts. Since I love this app, that's a very reasonable price and worth it. Something I love about this app is the interface and so many options to customize transactions. 👍🏻❤️",5
TrackWallet,Paul Clyde Cabezas,very helpful,5
TrackWallet,Kirill Muravev,"Excellent and well-thought design, thanks for this pleasure! But I couldn't migrate to this app yet, because: 1. It'd be useful to add filtering by subcategories (i.e. to see spending trend on cafés for last months) 2. Option to import .csv is needed 3. Absolutely non-essential, but nice to have: tap&hold to select several transactions and count total expense; swipe left-right to switch months (see Realbyte's Money Manager to try both)",5
TrackWallet,Thilini Wijetunge,Wow.. amazing .. super organising capabilities with this app..,5
TrackWallet,Xavier Ho,Wish to be able to import my expenses so I can fully migrate!,5
TrackWallet,Priyanka Bhutani,So far the best app! Please provide the feature of sign-in so that data can be recovered if mistakenly app is deleted. I WOULD RATE THIS APP 5 STAR IF THIS FEATURE WOULD BE ABLE !,3
TrackWallet,yazwan s.,I have been using for 2 or 3 months. The UI UX design is excellent! which is easy to understand and modern looks. The budget features also is excellent.

Looking forward to your development apps. 🤩 Appreciate it! That the apps is clean from ads even at non-premium user level.,4
TrackWallet,mohit jalan,Cannot do payment with any method,1
TrackWallet,RAHUL S,"Your premium is worth if there should be profile for family members like husband, wife, mother, father and then their separate bank accounts, payment wallets, bank fixed deposits with auto interest calculator, insurance policies, investments, loans, credit card balance, mutual funds, stocks investment and movable and immovable assests, etc",1

TrackWallet,shairah367,"The best budget app so far after checking out almost all of budget app in the play store. UI is amazing and very clean. Easy to navigate and add transactions. It's perfect. I found everything I need in this app. Just a few suggestions, please add ""Goals/Savings"" feature and bills or recurring transactions reminder before it be added to transactions. So that it won't be added automatically to expenses even if it hasn't been paid yet. Thank you.",5
