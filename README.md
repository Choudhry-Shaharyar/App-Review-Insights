# **App Review Insights: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling**

## **Overview**
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze app reviews from app stores. It aims to extract valuable insights from user feedback, perform sentiment analysis, and identify key topics using tools such as TextBlob, Vader, and machine learning models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). By applying these techniques, the project demonstrates real-world applications of design principles, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

## **Skills Gained**

### **1. Web Scraping & Data Collection**
- Gather app reviews from various app stores using web scraping techniques.
- Compile the extracted reviews into a structured CSV format for further analysis.

### **2. Text Preprocessing**
- Clean and preprocess review text by:
  - Removing punctuation, special characters, and emojis.
  - Converting numbers into text.
  - Lemmatizing and turning all words into lowercase.
- Prepare text for machine learning tasks by eliminating noise and standardizing formats.

### **3. Sentiment Analysis**
- Apply sentiment analysis using **TextBlob** and **Vader** to determine the polarity of app reviews.
- Compare and contrast the sentiment scores generated by both models.
- Analyze how sentiment results relate to app user ratings.

### **4. Prompt Engineering**
- Utilize large language models like GPT-3 for sentiment analysis.
- Compare the output of GPT-3 with traditional sentiment analysis tools such as TextBlob and Vader, discussing differences and similarities.

### **5. Topic Modeling (Machine Learning)**
- Use **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** to extract topics from user reviews.
- Associate the extracted topics with app features.
- Compare the topics between your assigned app and its competitors or similar apps to understand key areas of feedback and feature requests.
